The files in BellendenRd/currentCost are named in chronological order.
Typically there is a gap of about a day between files.

The data in this folder were logged using my currentCostCosmTX Python script:
https://github.com/JackKelly/currentCostCosmTX


CHANGE IN FILE NAMING ON 27th JUNE 2012
=======================================

Prior to 27th June 2012, files were named "currentCostDataXY.dat".
After 27th June 2012, all data will be stored in the "data.csv" file.


CURRENTCOST INDIVIDUAL APPLIANCE MONITORS (IAMs)
================================================

One Weds 20th June 2012 I added three CurrentCost Individual Appliance Monitors 
so files BellendenRd/currentCost/currentCostData23.dat onwards have three 
columns:

* col1 is the Unix timestamp
* col2 is the sensor number
* col3 is the power reading

The CurrentCost IAMs sample once every six seconds. Sometimes the 
receiver fails to receive a sample so about 10% of the samples get dropped
(this failure rate increases with distance between the sensor and the receiver).

I sometimes turn off appliances from the mains (because I am trying to keep my
energy consumption to a minimum).  If an IAM is disconnected from the
mains then it no longer transmits and hence does not appear in the data file.  
Hence if a sensor does not appear for a while then it is safe to assume that the
appliance is off.


MAPPING FROM SENSOR NUMBER TO APPLIANCE NAME
============================================

0  Whole-house aggregate consumption measured using a CurrentCost CT clamp
1  42" CRT TV
2  Fridge-freezer
3  Jack's HP laptop


DATA ON COSM (formerly "Pachube")
=================================

Aggregate data up until 26th June 2012 is available on the
"currentCost" datastream on feed https://cosm.com/feeds/49595

After 26th June 2012, data from all sensors are being logged to
feed https://cosm.com/feeds/64961
