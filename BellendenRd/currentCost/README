The files in BellendenRd/currentCost are named in chronological order.
Typically there is a gap of about a day between files.

The whole-house CurrentCost data for BellendenRd is also available on Cosm.com:

CURRENTCOST INDIVIDUAL APPLIANCE MONITORS (IAMs)
================================================

One Weds 20th June 2012 I added three CurrentCost Individual Appliance Monitors 
so files BellendenRd/currentCost/currentCostData23.dat onwards have three 
columns:

* col1 is the Unix timestamp
* col2 is the sensor number
* col3 is the power reading

The CurrentCost IAMs sample once every six seconds. Sometimes the 
receiver fails to receive a sample so about 10% of the samples get dropped
(this failure rate increases with distance between the sensor and the receiver).

I sometimes turn off appliances from the mains (because I am trying to keep my
energy consumption to a minimum).  If an IAM is disconnected from the
mains then it no longer transmits and hence does not appear in the data file.  
Hence if a sensor does not appear for a while then it is safe to assume that the
appliance is off.
