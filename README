Domestic power data recorded by Jack Kelly 2011-2012

This dataset contains data from two houses: "JerninghamRd" and "BellendenRd".

Each house contains a "wattsUp" folder and a "currentCost" folder:


WATTSUP FOLDER
==============

The "wattsUp" folder contains individual appliance data recorded using a
WattsUp meter [1]. The WattsUp records at a sample rate of 1Hz. It can record
a number of parameters including voltage, power and power factor. Most of the
files in the wattsUp folder are CSV files with just a single column recording
power.  A few of the files in the wattsUp folder also include other parameters 
(the first row of these files provides human-readable names for these 
parameters).


CURRENTCOST FOLDER
==================

The "currentCost" folder contains whole-house, aggregate data recorded using a
CurrentCost EnviR home energy monitor [2].  This records apparent power once 
every six seconds (although occasionally the EnviR drops a sample).  These 
files contain two columns: the first column is the UNIX timestamp and the 
second column is the power reading.

The files in BellendenRd/currentCost are named in chronological order.  
Typically there is a gap of about a day between files.

The whole-house CurrentCost data for BellendenRd is also available on Cosm.com:
https://cosm.com/feeds/49595 (the "currentCost" feed)


CURRENTCOST INDIVIDUAL APPLIANCE MONITORS (IAMs)
================================================

One Weds 20th June 2012 I added three CurrentCost Individual Appliance Monitors
[3] so file BellendenRd/currentCost/currentCostData23.dat onwards have three 
columns:

* col1 is the Unix timestamp
* col2 is the sensor number
* col3 is the power reading

See the README file in BellendenRd/currentCost for details of the mapping 
between sensor number and appliance name.


FUTURE PLANS
============

On 22nd June 2012 I ordered 24 CurrentCost Individual Monitors (to monitor the 
power consumption of the majority of appliances in my home).

I will also order an OpenEnergyMonitor [4] which should allow me to monitor 
voltage, real power and reactive power once a second for my entire house.

A blog entry about these plans is available at:
